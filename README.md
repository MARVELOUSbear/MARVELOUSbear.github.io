## Project objective

This project is a course project in [CS5610 Web Development at Northeastern University](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2021/). This website is a presentation of my web development skill and an introduction of myself. It consists of three pages: the home page, the introduction page, and the hobbies page. The introduction page includes a brief self-introduction, education, and work experience. The hobbies page includes two sections with different ways of image-text combination layout and an interactive multiple-choice section implemented with JavaScript. I adopted the flat design style and try to practice minimalism while presenting adequate information. Most colors used on the components in this website are chosen from the Morandi color palette to deliver a peaceful and comfortable viewing experience.

This page consists of a top navbar, a side navbar, and three sections. The side navbar will be fixed on the left of the page while you scrolling down this page, and all the menu options in this navbar can be used to jump to the position of the corresponding section.
