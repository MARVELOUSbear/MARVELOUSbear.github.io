## Project objective

This project is a course project in [CS5610 Web Development at Northeastern University](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_spring_2021/). This website is a presentation of my web development skill and an introduction of myself. It consists of three pages: the home page, the introduction page, and the hobbies page. The introduction page includes a breif self introduction, education, and work experience. The hobbies page includes two sections with different ways of image-text combination layout, and an pure JavaScript interactive multiple choice section. I adopted the flat design style and try to practice minimalism while presenting adequate information. Most colors used on the components in this website are chosen from the Morandi color palette to deliver a peaceful and comfortable viewing experience.
